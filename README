  ocaml-mysql is a package for ocaml that provides access to mysql 
databases. It consists of low level functions implemented in C and a
module Mysql intended for application development. 
  

1  Building
*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  Compiling this package from sources requires the following software to
be installed on your system:
  
   
 1. ocaml 3.09 or above.
 2. findlib  
 3. The mysql client library and header files.  
 4. An ANSI C compiler like gcc.
  
  A configure script is provided which should help to find the
particular files. In case configure fails, edit the setting in the
config file directly. This also applies when the C compiler fails to
find some include file. However, you should first try the obvious:
               
              <<
                    % ./configure
                    % make
                    % make opt
                    % make install
              >>
  
  This creates the mysql libraries.
  
2  Trouble Shooting
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*

  
  If compilation fails this is most probably because include or library
files were not found. The configure looks in a number of places but may
fail to find the files on your system. In case you have GNU Autoconf
installed you can take a look at the configure.in and add more
directories to search: 
               
              <<
                AC_CHECKING(for MySQL header files)
                dnl
                dirs="/usr/local/include
                      /usr/local/mysql/include
                      /usr/include
                      /usr/include/mysql"
              >>
  
  Do not forget to create a new configure script by invoking autoconf.
Please send a patch back to the author.
  

3. Documentation
*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

   
   Check the interface files, or doc/index.html.
  Reading the mysql documentation should help, too.
  A small demo demo.ml is provided. You can try it in the mysqltop ocaml
interpreter that make all should have built. 
  

  Note: The library can now be used in multithreaded ocaml programs without
  blocking threads during i/o with the database server. However, only one
  thread should use mysql functions. Better support for multi-threaded servers
  using libmysqlclient_r coming someday.
